# ShardedOS
ShardedOS is an open-source project that distributes system resources across multiple physical machines to create a unified, secure environment. Inspired by Qubes OS, it aims to maintain strong isolation while using lightweight Debian installations on bare metal nodes. The goal is to pool resources seamlessly under a single, manageable interface.
